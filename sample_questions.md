1) A company is storing an access key (access key ID and secret access key) in a text file on a custom AMI. The company 
uses the access key to access DynamoDB tables from instances created from the AMI. The security team has mandated a more 
secure solution.

Which solution will meet the security teamâ€™s mandate?

    A. Put the access key in an S3 bucket, and retrieve the access key on boot from the instance.
    B. Pass the access key to the instances through instance user data.
    C. Obtain the access key from a key server launched in a private subnet.
    D. Create an IAM role with permissions to access the table, and launch all instances with the new role.
    
Answer: D

2) A company is developing a highly available web application using stateless web servers. 

Which services are suitable for storing session state data? (Select TWO.)

    A. CloudWatch
    B. DynamoDB
    C. Elastic Load Balancing
    D. ElastiCache
    E. Storage Gateway
    
Answer: B, D

3) Company salespeople upload their sales figures daily. A Solutions Architect needs a durable storage solution for 
these documents that also protects against users accidentally deleting important documents.

Which action will protect against unintended user actions?

    A. Store data in an EBS volume and create snapshots once a week.
    B. Store data in an S3 bucket and enable versioning.
    C. Store data in two S3 buckets in different AWS regions.
    D. Store data on EC2 instance storage.
    
Answer: B


4) An application requires a highly available relational database with an initial storage capacity of 8 TB. The 
database will grow by 8 GB every day. To support expected traffic, at least eight read replicas will be required to 
handle database reads.

Which option will meet these requirements?
    
    A. DynamoDB
    B. Amazon S3
    C. Amazon Aurora
    D. Amazon Redshift
    
Answer: C
 
5) A Solutions Architect is designing a critical business application with a relational database that runs on an EC2 
instance. It requires a single EBS volume that can support up to 16,000 IOPS.

Which Amazon EBS volume type can meet the performance requirements of this application?

    A. EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD
    B. EBS Throughput Optimized HDD
    C. EBS General Purpose SSD
    D. EBS Cold HDD
    
Answer: C


6) A web application allows customers to upload orders to an S3 bucket. The resulting Amazon S3 events trigger a Lambda 
function that inserts a message to an SQS queue. A single EC2 instance reads messages from the queue, processes them, 
and stores them in an DynamoDB table partitioned by unique order ID. Next month traffic is expected to increase by a 
factor of 10 and a Solutions Architect is reviewing the architecture for possible scaling problems.

Which component is MOST likely to need re-architecting to be able to scale to accommodate the new traffic?

    A. Lambda function
    B. SQS queue
    C. EC2 instance
    D. DynamoDB table
    
Answer: C

7) An application saves the logs to an S3 bucket. A user wants to keep the logs for one month for troubleshooting 
purposes, and then purge the logs.

What feature will enable this?

    A. Adding a bucket policy on the S3 bucket.
    B. Configuring lifecycle configuration rules on the S3 bucket.
    C. Creating an IAM policy for the S3 bucket.
    D. Enabling CORS on the S3 bucket.

Answer: A
