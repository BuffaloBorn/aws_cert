Your order-processing application processes orders extracted from a queue with two
Reserved Instances processing 10 orders/minute. If an order fails during processing,

to drain it so that customers get their confirmation emails faster. What is a cost-effective
way to drain the queue for orders?

- A. Create more queues.
- **B. Deploy additional Spot Instances to assist in processing the orders.**
- C. Deploy additional Reserved Instances to assist in processing the orders.
- D. Deploy additional On-Demand Instances to assist in processing the orders.
