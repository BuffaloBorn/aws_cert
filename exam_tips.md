### IAM - Identity Access Management 

* IAM consists of the following:
    - Users 
    - Groups ( A way to group our users and apply polices to them collectively ) 
    - Roles 
    - Policy Documents.
        - are made up of javascript object notation. 
* IAM is universal. It does not apply to regions at this time. 
    - region that you perform IAM actions in does not matter.
* The "root account" is simply the account created when first setup your AWS account. 
    - It has complete Admin access by default.
* New Users have NO permissions when first created. 
* New Users are assigned Access Key ID & Secret Access Keys when first created.
* These are not the same as a password, and you cannot use Access Key ID & Secret Access Key to login in to console. You can use this to access AWS via the APIs ans Command Line however.
* You only get to view these once. If you lose them, you have to regenerate them. So save them in secure location. 
* Always setup Multifactor Authentication on your root account.
* You can create and customize your own password rotation policies.

* Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)
* S3 Storage Classes/Tiers
    - S3 (durable, immediately available, frequently accessed)

    - Version ID
    - Metadata
    - Subresources
        - ACL
        - Torrent
